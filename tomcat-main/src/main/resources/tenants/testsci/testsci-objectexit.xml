			This field is used by the Service layer's unit tests only.  The tests will create the vocabulary/term-list, add terms,
			and then delete the vocabulary.  Before deleting the vocabulary, the tests will create an instance of this record (CollectionObject) and
			place a term of type "vocab-test" into this "testField".  The DELETE request should fail since the term is being referenced by an active record.  Only
			after deleting this record instance (CollectionObject), will the test be able to delete the vocabulary/term-list.
