<!--
    A reusable complex type for storing address information.

    There is an existing address group in contacts, named addressGroup.
    
    This group is different from that group in that some fields are tied to
    the place authority, instead of being free text or controlled lists.
    Therefore this group needs to have a different name, so that the
    addressGroup table doesn't end up having a mix of refnames and non-
    refnames in some columns.
    
    The name of this group is addrGroup. At some point contacts should be
    converted to use this group as well, and the values in the addressGroup
    table should be migrated to the addrGroup table. At that point the
    addressGroup table can be deleted.
